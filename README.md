## Introduction
Restsend is a secure embeding instant messaging system. This is the client SDK of Restsend, which is written in Rust. It provides SDK implementations for Android and iOS. It requires a certain version of Rust. If the version is lower than `1.72.0`, you need to update the Rust version first by `rustup update`.
